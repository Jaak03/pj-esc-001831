You can find the documentation for this project [here](https://tri2be.notion.site/Documentation-61ee720b44bd4719b5f81f618730dfc4?pvs=4).

The readme file is for developers to get it up and running so that they can contribute to the project. The documentation is where user-related info will be shared.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started ##
The repo is using Laravel Sail to run the project. You can find the documentation for Laravel Sail [here](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail).

```shell
# Start the local development environment.
sail up -d
```

You can run a list of commands from inside the docker container, an example of this would be starting the Vite 
service insided the container.

Other services that I know of include:
* artisan
* composer
* yarn
* php

```shell
# Start Vite's development server.
sail yarn dev
```
